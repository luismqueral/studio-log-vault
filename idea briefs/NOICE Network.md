*Network of Interconnected Content Engines* is the parent group of multi-media bots that exists on various platforms. In a mature state, they reference each other and even speak to each other.

**Platforms:**
- Static Sites
- Youtube
- Soundcloud
- Twitter/Bluesky
- Google Sheets
- Google Docs
- Google Slides

**Misc. Notes:**
- These will have to be hosted on a server (diagram TBD)
- I would like to have some sort of front-end that allows me to view logs
